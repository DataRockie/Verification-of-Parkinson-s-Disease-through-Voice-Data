# Verification-of-Parkinson-s-Disease-through-Voice-Data
Predict whether the person suffers from Parkinson's Diseases by using vocalization data and applying supervised machine learning learning algorithms on it. Parkinsonâ€™s is a progressive disease that causes the degeneration of the brain, leading to both motor and cognitive problems. The dataset I have obtained was from 2008 study by the journal, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. With the help of classification I have found that the voice data is the best way to verify Parkinson's in a patient.

##What I have Done
I have implemented various Supervised classification algorithm(Naive Bayes, SVM, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gradient Tree Boosting). I have also plotted a scatter matrix to get the better grasp of data and understand the relationship between features.

Further tunning is done on SVM on the basis of F1 score and final best model is obtained
